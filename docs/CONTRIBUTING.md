## Checkstyle

This project uses checkstyle with a local configuration file for consistent formatting.

Builds will fail if your code format doesn't adhere to the standard. Therefore it is *highly encouraged* that you:

* Install the Checkstyle plugin on your IDE of choice
* Configure the plugin to use the local `config/checkstyle.xml` file as the active ruleset
* Import the checkstyle file to your IDE's code style settings

[This page](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSPACE/Code+Style+Guide#CodeStyleGuide-IDESupport) covers the steps above
for the most used IDEs.
